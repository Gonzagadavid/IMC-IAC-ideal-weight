#  Calculation of BMI, IAC and ideal weight :no_entry_sign: :hamburger: :fries: 



Calculating BMI was my first personal project, as my knowledge progressed, I saw the need to redo it. In addition, I added the IAC calculation to put two different code approaches into practice on the same project.

CSS :

-  The use of a class for several elements of the same theme, making the code leaner;

-  Page responsiveness for different display sizes.

  

  DOM/JavaScript:

-  The use of forms to request user data;
-  The manipulation of elements through the ID;
-  The use of check-boxes.

JavaScript:

-  BMI: data are calculated and verified to return the correct feedback to the user through functions;
- IAC: through a constructor function, an instance is created, passing the data as parameters. Using methods, the IAC is calculated and the level is checked to return the correct feedback to the user
-  Ideal weight: in the field of BMI, the user's ideal weight is also calculated, when only height or height and weight are passed
